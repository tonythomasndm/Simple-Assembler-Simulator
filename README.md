# CSE112-22-Assignment-SimpleAssemblerSimulator

This repository holds the frame of our project.
Please download the entire folder and make no modifications to the frame.
Just add your files in the right directory, and modify the run files according to need.

Naming Convention for the source files: SimpleAssembler, SimpleSimulator.
Written in Python Programming Language
Assembler - It converts the assembly instructions into binary executables
Simulator  - It reads the binary executables and performs the action according to transcribed assembly instructions and prints the values of the registers during each cycle, does a memory dump at last

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUN FILE: All the run files need to be granted permission/privilege for execution.
Eg. for Linux systems, go to the folder of each run file using bash/terminal and write "chmod +x run" {without quotes}.

To run the results for your assembler, go to the Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permissions to the run file, type "./run --no-sim" {without quotes}.

To run the results for your simulator, go to the Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permissions to the run file, type "./run --no-asm" {without quotes}.

To run the results for both, the assembler and the simulator, go to the Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permissions to the run file, type "./run" or "./run --verbose" [for verbose output] {without quotes}.
